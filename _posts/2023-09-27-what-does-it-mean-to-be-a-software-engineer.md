Software Engineer, it's about engineering, so you need to have a logical thinking mind, but not only.
This kind of job requires contacts with other people, thus the importance of soft skills.

You need to talk to people, you need to manage your tasks, you have to know how to solve the things which you are 
assigned to you. So you have to have this mind which can solve many different problems.

You should also be kind of a creative person because there are a lot of changes when you are working as 
a software engineering developer. You have to be creative in what you are doing and you have to like it, if you want to have a happy life.

It's worth to mention that it's not always easy to know from the start `Who you want to be?`.
I think you need to choose a profession that is enjoyable for you as a person.

Personally, before I have become a software engineer, I worked in a lot of other places. So I think that anybody 
who is thinking about this profession should not worry much. 

Follow your feelings and jump into it, because there is a lot of things to learn, understand and know, 
it takes time to get there and to have that feeling of `oh, I know how to do this!` it requires experience.

Talking about experiences, past experience do not need to be strictly be related to software engineering.

The knowledge accumulated during these experiences could be used to enhance your software engineers growth.

Find below passages from the life of our colleagues regarding 
skills they've gained in time, which they are using today in their current profession as software engineers.

<i>"My knowledge background is not even from IT, I am a biologist and I have worked at a university.
I have worked at a construction site when I couldn't find a job. 
I worked in a shop where I had to deal with many different types of people and learn how to talk to them.
When I worked in a shop, that taught me a lot, on `How to talk with people?`, `How to convince them?`. 

<i>That's something that I use in my day-to-day work now as a software engineer.

<i>Without this background, I think I would not be able to jump so easily into this current job.
If you look at it from software engineer perspective my growth path actually started from the soft skills side of it, 
with things like talking with the customer, dealing with different type of people.

<i>While I was doing my master paper on biology and later on when I worked in the university, so I had projects where 
I needed to coordinate with other teams, join many meetings to discuss our progress and so on.
It's kind of similar to what we are doing now in the software engineering project, all the feature demos and status sharing meetings.

<i>This part of my life also kind of taught me on how to think logically because, this direction is not a humanistic way of thinking.
It's colder, machine like, it's similar to thinking about the stuff that composes our ecosystems, how things interact and so on.
This is a similarity which kind forces me think about the software as a whole: `How it works?` and `How it interacts?`.

<i>Nothing is separated in a complicated software and the same can be said for the natural environment, which we are living in."

<i>"Since when I was little, I had a passion or interest for technology, initially hardware. 
I was always like fixing and breaking things, most of the time breaking and then fixing it by myself.
That's the best way to learn in my opinion.

<i>I've started working from a young age basically when I was 15. I was selling goods, this gave me that possibility to interact with different people and
it provided me with that window of how to interact with others and understanding `How they behave?` and `What their goals are?`
This experience it gave me that level of emotional intelligence that it's very useful and helpful in software engineering collaborative efforts.

<i>My first experience with software was in high school. We had this session or let's a class actually, 
that was for learning a very old programming language, which I'm not recalling the name right now.

<i>During the lesson time, I was approaching the teacher like, okay, you're dictating us how these functions 
are working or how these loops are being done and so on, but `How can I touch this stuff? I wanted to build something with it!`
She gave me some directions and the first thing that I built was basically a program that allowed packaging software products for windows.

<i>The experience, it gave me a new perspective, I really liked and enjoyed it. 
That's when I decided that, okay, I want to learn this, I want to learn how to build stuff. I want to go into the software world, not just hardware.

<i>I decided that on my university path, I'm going to pick something related to technology itself.
However, I was not one of the brightest on my class. I really didn't learn all the subjects. I liked cutting corners, man.
The only thing that I was learning at the time was physics and mathematics and everything else was like falling through the cracks.

<i>The problem was that I needed to have very, very good grades to get into some good university. 
But still with my grades at the time, I managed to move to Geoinformatics, which allowed me to follow the softer side 
of it and understand some of the concepts we needed to learn.

<i>School is good for understanding theory, but I didn't wait for school to actually start solving problems.
Since high school I started working with different types of projects. 

<i>My next adventure was building software for bars (points of sales), initially started with C, later moved to C++ language.
I did a terrible job on the first iteration. The software wasn't working that well or the UI was very ugly.
The code was unmaintainable, really, really, very bad job, but at least it allowed me to understand some of the concepts.

<i>It allowed me to understand how things are interacting, especially that was the first time that I needed to work with a database.
I understood what a database was how stored and read data. I didn't have the full concept of what SQL was at the time, 
I learned that later on in the game, but still, just with some will and desire, I managed to build something.

<i>Thanks to past experiences I'm at the point that I'm not scared of whatever programming language I need to use to solve
a given problem. I'm not an expert in some of those languages and I definitely prefer Java in my case, but i can easily take on any kind of projects.

Being a software engineer is not just about technical expertise. 
It's a journey that can start from early experiences, and continue through various paths. 

Every individual's journey into software engineering is unique, and past experiences, 
even those unrelated to software engineering, can shape one's perspective and approach to the profession.

Based on the Software Engineering knowledge the individual accumulates the expertise can be categorized as below:

Junior Level
: Somebody that has just started exploring software engineering.

Intermediate Level
: Somebody that has a couple of years of experience in software engineering. They know some set of skills from technical, infrastructure and soft side.

Senior Level
: Somebody that would be considered a tenured software engineer that has spent probably 5+ years in the industry and has a couple of different projects under the belt.

Lead Level
: Somebody that is able to potentially understand probably 90% of the items categorized as technical skills, has a solid knowledge of the infrastructure skills and is very good at soft skills with abilities to manage and coordinate different team members.

Expert Level
: Somebody that mastered the entire tree of software engineering knowledge with regard to technical, infrastructure and soft skills.


## Technical Skills
Refer to specific knowledge and abilities required to design, develop, test, and maintain software applications and systems. 
The knowledge accumulated by understanding these skills allows a person to understand `How to solve problems with software?`.

Usually software needs to deal with data and specialized knowledge is required for knowing `How to manage data?`.
The question can be answered by building a good understanding of <b>Data Structure</b> and <b>Algorithms</b>.

Let's imagine we have some type of data that we need to manage in our software like a birthday or certain numbers(doing accounting).

We need a way to manage these data during interactions while our software is running.
We need to store them, quickly search or sort, so we can remove or modify them.

The structures used to store these data represents the <b>Data Structure</b> and the operations needed to modify, search and sort data represents the <b>Algorithms</b>.

Management of data can be achieved by using  different structures like: Arrays, Lists and Trees;

There are way more data structures than the three mentioned above. However, this is only the beginning stage and
for simplicity we will start reference only some of the areas that are needed for reaching Junior Level, remaining areas will be expanded in future materials.

The next skill set is <b>Programming Languages</b>. This is the building blocks of the 
software creation process, and no software could be created without it. Well known programing languages are: Java, Python, C, C#, C++, Rust, Haskell;

The list of programming languages is long and can be used to solve different type of problems. 
Some languages exist for fun, just to show a concept, in here we will talk mainly about languages which
can be used to solve different types of real world problems.

As you move into this direction is important to select a programming language and own it.
You don't need to know all possible languages, it's good to focus on understanding concepts, 
because you can apply these concepts in different type of languages. 

As an example the concept of loops is the same in all programming languages, the syntax(how it's written)
will be different but the behavior it's the same, the loop will iterate over a list of elements.

It's important to become an expert on the selected language, because that gives you the ability to be valuable for the market
and this will speed up your career options.

There are a lot of skills on the technical list, it's really long, and it keeps growing because technology moves ahead.

## Am I eligible to be a Software Engineer?
(set of skills and hidden potential)
Bigger view (when working on a project)
It’s not just sitting in front of a computer (a very specific and intense way of thinking)
Soft skills are just as important as hard ones (more communication than someone might think)
Only the change is certain (changes in requirements, task vs time)
Each project is different and gives different opportunities (growth path should not be neglected, but also not be taken too seriously)
If you get involved in this profession, remember not to entirely lose yourself in it (remember about work-life balance)
useful questions:
- How to start? Do you remember how you get started in your SE carrier? (education vs self-thought)
- Do you think it’s worth going that way? (time, commitment, fulfillment, payoff)
- Do you feel fulfilled in your job?
- Do you think that technical knowledge must be mastered from start to finish? Is it even possible?

## Conclusion

>  A software engineer is a person that uses a set of skills (technical, infrastructure and soft) to solve different types of problems.
