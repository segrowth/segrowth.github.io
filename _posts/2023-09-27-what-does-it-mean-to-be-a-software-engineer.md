Software Engineer, it's about engineering, so you need to have a logical thinking mind, but not only.
This kind of job requires contacts with other people, thus the importance of soft skills.

You need to talk to people, you need to manage your tasks, you have to know how to solve the things which you are 
assigned. So you have to have this mind which can solve many different problems.

You should also be kind of a creative person because there are a lot of changes when you are working as 
a software engineering developer. You have to be creative in what you are doing and you have to like it, if you want to have a happy life. 
I think you need to choose a profession that is enjoyable for you as a person.

It's worth to mention that it's not always easy to know from the start `who you want to be`.

Personally, before I have become a software engineer, I worked in a lot of other places. So I think that anybody 
who is thinking about this profession should not worry much. 

Follow your feelings and jump into it, because there is a lot of things to learn, understand and know, 
it takes time to get there and to have that feeling of, `oh, I know how to do this.`

#### Benefits of past experiences
Talking about past experiences, previous experience do not need to be strictly related to software engineering.

I know we're talking about software engineering, and we don't need to talk too much about the past experience, 
but mainly we want to focus on: 
- What activities did we do?
- What did we get from those experiences?
- How did those activities helped us become better software engineers?

Even though past experiences are not strictly related to software engineering, the knowledge accumulated during 
these experiences could be used to enhance your software engineers growth.

Find below passages from the life of our colleagues regarding 
skills they've gained in time, which they are using today in their current profession as software engineers.

<i>"My knowledge background is not even from IT, I am a biologist and I have worked at a university.
I have worked at a construction site when I couldn't find a job. 
I worked in a shop where I had to deal with many different types of people and learn how to talk to them.
When I worked in a shop, that taught me a lot, on `How to talk with people?`, `How to convince them?`. 

<i>That's something that I use in my day-to-day work now as a software engineer.

<i>Without this background, I think I would not be able to jump so easily into this current job.
If you look at it from software engineer perspective my growth path actually started from the soft skills side of it, 
with things like talking with the customer, dealing with different type of people.

<i>While I was doing my master paper on biology and later on when I worked in the university, so I had projects where 
I needed to coordinate with other teams, join many meetings to discuss our progress and so on.
It's kind of similar to what we are doing now in the software engineering project, all the feature demos and status sharing meetings.

<i>This part of my life also kind of taught me on how to think logically because, this direction is not a humanistic way of thinking.
It's colder, machine like, it's similar to thinking about the stuff that composes our ecosystems, how things interact and so on.
This is a similarity which kind forces me think about the software as a whole: `How it works?` and `How it interacts?`.

<i>Nothing is separated in a complicated software and the same can be said for the natural environment, which we are living in."

> The software we build is a reflection of the teams and corporations that build that software.

<i>"Since when I was little, I had a passion or interest for technology, when I say technology is not just software, 
it's also hardware. I was always like fixing and breaking stuff, most of the time breaking and then fixing it by myself.
That's the best way to learn in my opinion.

<i>My first experience with software engineering was actually in high school. We had this session or let's a class actually, 
was for learning a very old programming language, which I'm not recalling the name right now.

<i>During the lesson time, I was approaching the teacher like, okay, you're dictating us how these functions 
are working or how these loops are being done and so on. But how can I touch this stuff? I wanted to build something with it!
She gave me some directions and the first thing that I built was basically a program that allowed packaging software products for windows.

<i>I don't know, it gave me a new perspective, I really liked and enjoyed the experience. 
That's when I decided that, okay, I want to learn this, I want to learn how to build stuff. I want to go into the software world, not just hardware.

<i>I decided that on my university path, I'm going to pick something related to technology itself.
However, I was not one of the brightest on my class. I really didn't learn all the subjects. I liked cutting corners, man.
The only thing that I was learning at the time was physics and mathematics and everything else was like falling through the cracks.

<i>The problem was that I needed to have very, very good grades to get into some good university. 
But still with my grades at the time, I managed to move to Geoinformatics, which allowed me to follow the softer side 
of it and understand some of the concepts we needed to learn.

<i>School is good for understanding theory, but I didn't wait for school to actually touch and solve problems.
Since high school is started working with different types of projects, 

<i>My next adventure was building software for bars (points of sales), initially started was with C, later C++ languages, 
was quite interesting. I did a terrible job on the first iteration. The software wasn't working that well or it was very ugly.
The code was unmaintainable, really, really, very bad job, at least it allowed me to understand some of the concepts.

<i>It allowed me to understand how things are interacting, especially that was the first time that I needed to work with a database.
I understood what a database is how store and read stuff. I didn't have the full concept of what SQL was at the time, 
I learned that later on in the game, but still, just with some will and desire, I managed.

<i>Thanks to past experiences I'm at the point that I'm not scared of whatever programming language I need to use to solve
a given problem. I'm not an expert in some of those languages and I definitely prefer Java in my case.

<i>That was a brief summary of my experience with software, however in general I've started working from a young age basically 
when I was 15. I was selling stuff at the beginning, which gave me that possibility to interact with different people and
it provided me with that window of how to interact with others and understanding `How they behave?` and `What their goals are?`

<i>It gives you that emotional intelligence that you need, that it's very useful and helpful in software engineering.

Being a software engineer is not just about technical expertise. 
It's a journey that can start from early experiences, and continue through various paths. 

Every individual's journey into software engineering is unique, and past experiences, 
even those unrelated to software engineering, can shape one's perspective and approach to the profession.

>  A software engineer is a person that uses a set of skills (technical, infrastructure and soft) to solve different types of problems.

## Am I eligible to be a Software Engineer?
(set of skills and hidden potential)
Bigger view (when working on a project)
It’s not just sitting in front of a computer (a very specific and intense way of thinking)
Soft skills are just as important as hard ones (more communication than someone might think)
Only the change is certain (changes in requirements, task vs time)
Each project is different and gives different opportunities (growth path should not be neglected, but also not be taken too seriously)
If you get involved in this profession, remember not to entirely lose yourself in it (remember about work-life balance)
useful questions:
- How to start? Do you remember how you get started in your SE carrier? (education vs self-thought)
- Do you think it’s worth going that way? (time, commitment, fulfillment, payoff)
- Do you feel fulfilled in your job?
- Do you think that technical knowledge must be mastered from start to finish? Is it even possible?
